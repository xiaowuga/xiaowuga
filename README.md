## Hi there 👋

My name is Jing-En Jiang (江敬恩). I am now a third year Ph.D student at Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC), Shandong University (SDU), under the supervision of Prof. Changhe Tu and Prof. Shiqing Xin. 

My current research focuses on CAD feature detection and suppression. I’m also interested in cutting-edge fields like 3D generation, embodied intelligence, and reinforcement learning. Seeking internships in these areas to gain practice and enhance professional skills—feel free to reach out if you have relevant opportunities.

Outside of work, I am a big fan of Rubik’s cube.

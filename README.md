## Hi there 👋

My name is Jing-En Jiang (江敬恩). I am now a third year Ph.D student at Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC), Shandong University (SDU), under the supervision of Prof. Changhe Tu and Prof. Shiqing Xin. I am also working closely with Dr. Mingyang Zhao.

Outside of work, I am a big fan of Rubik’s cube.
